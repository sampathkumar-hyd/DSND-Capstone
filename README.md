### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.x

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Starbucks rewards app data to better understand:

  1. How would a customer respond to an offer from Starbucks?
  2. What are the top contributing features for the prediction model?

### File Descriptions
The project consists of 3 JSON files. These are the data files. They are named as
  1. portfolio.json
  2. profile.json
  3. transcript.json

The transcript.json is too big to be uploaded into github and hence has been compressed into transcript.json.zip file and uploaded. You should unzip the file into transcript.json before executing the notebook.

The project also consists of a notebook to show case the actual analysis - Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@vskumar/will-they-or-wont-they-991b48957b2c).

### Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
The data for this analysis was downloaded from Udacity and Starbucks. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
